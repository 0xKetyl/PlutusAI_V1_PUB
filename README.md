To optimize our reward distribution mechanism, we require your Solana addresses. Please comment your SOL address below this post https://x.com/CommunAIst_SOL/status/1870886022197735460

This action will create a crucial link between your Twitter handle and on-chain identity, enabling our AI agent, StAIline, to accurately allocate $ComAI rewards.

Our system utilizes a fine-tuned NLP model to analyze engagement metrics, which are then correlated with on-chain identities. This process ensures precise and fair token distribution based on your participation.

By providing your address, you're not only securing your rewards but also contributing to the improvement of our federated learning model. Remember, StAIline's efficiency grows with each data point.

Engage with our content and earn your share of the redistribution. The revolution of AI-driven tokenomics awaits your participation.
