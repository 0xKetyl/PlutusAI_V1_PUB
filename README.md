# TargetAI Token Distribution and AI Technology Overview

## Autonomous AI Agent: Target

Target is an autonomous AI agent responsible for managing its own wallet and making independent decisions regarding token distribution. It utilizes advanced algorithms to optimize reward allocation based on market conditions and community engagement.

## Market Capitalization-Based Distribution Formula

The distribution of tokens based on market capitalization milestones is defined as follows:

$$
D_{MC} = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } MC < 50,000 \\
\frac{T_{managed}}{7} & \text{if } 50,000 \leq MC < 100,000 \\
\left(\frac{T_{managed}}{7}\right) \times 2 & \text{if } 100,000 \leq MC < 250,000 \\
\left(\frac{T_{managed}}{7}\right) \times 3 & \text{if } 250,000 \leq MC < 500,000 \\
\left(\frac{T_{managed}}{7}\right) \times 4 & \text{if } 500,000 \leq MC < 1,000,000 \\
\left(\frac{T_{managed}}{7}\right) \times 5 & \text{if } 1,000,000 \leq MC < 3,000,000 \\
\left(\frac{T_{managed}}{7}\right) \times 6 & \text{if } 3,000,000 \leq MC < 5,000,000 \\
\frac{T_{managed}}{7} & \text{if } MC \geq 5,000,000
\end{cases}
$$


Where:
- \( D_{MC} \) = Amount of tokens distributed based on market cap
- \( T_{managed} = 2,500,000 \) (Total tokens managed by Target)
- \( MC = \) Market Capitalization (in USD)

## Social Media Engagement Rewards Formula

Tokens are also distributed based on engagement metrics from Target's tweets:

$$
D_{Engagement} = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } L < 10\\
1,000 & \text{if } L = 10\\
2,000 & \text{if } L = 100\\
5,000 & \text{if } L = 500\\
10,000 & \text{if } C + R > 50\\
15,000 & \text{if } C + R > 100
\end{cases}
$$


Where:
- \( D_{Engagement} = \) Amount of tokens distributed based on engagement
- \( L = \) Number of Likes on a Tweet
- \( C = \) Number of Comments on a Tweet
- \( R = \) Number of Retweets on a Tweet

## AI Technologies Utilized by Target

1. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Target employs machine learning to analyze real-time market data and user interactions for optimal reward distribution.
   
2. **Predictive Analytics**: By utilizing predictive analytics techniques such as regression analysis and time-series forecasting, Target can anticipate market trends and adjust distribution strategies accordingly.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLP is used to process community feedback and enhance user interactions with the platform.

4. **Smart Contracts**: The operational framework is built on smart contracts that automate the reward distribution process while ensuring transparency and security.

By integrating these technologies, Target exemplifies a sophisticated approach to decentralized finance that empowers users and fosters community engagement.
