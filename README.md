# SkillAI: Autonomous AI Agent Framework for Solana

![skillbanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0116d462-d0f0-454e-ae77-e10f5e4d7e10)


SkillAI is an open-source framework for creating autonomous AI agents that reward knowledge sharing and content creation on Solana.

## Roadmap (Q1 2025)

1. Core Framework Development
   - Implement basic AI agent architecture using Rust
   - Develop initial token distribution algorithms
   - Create NLP models for content evaluation

2. Solana Integration
   - Implement Solana program interface using Anchor
   - Develop on-chain state management for agent data
   - Create token minting and distribution mechanisms

3. Testing and Optimization
   - Conduct extensive testing on Solana devnet
   - Optimize gas usage and transaction throughput
   - Implement security audits and bug bounty program

## Technical Architecture

SkillAI is built on Solana using Rust and the Anchor framework:

### Core Components

- **Solana Program**: Main entry point for on-chain logic, implemented using Anchor
- **Agent Logic**: Rust modules for content analysis and reward calculation
- **State Management**: On-chain account structures for storing agent and user data
- **Token Distribution**: SPL Token integration for minting and distributing rewards

### Key Algorithms

let base_reward = (quality_score * engagement_rate) + (user_influence * viral_potential);
let network_adjustment = apply_network_dynamics(base_reward, network_state)?;

Ok(finalize_reward(network_adjustment))


### Scalability Features

- Efficient use of Solana's parallel transaction processing
- Optimized account structure to minimize storage costs
- Batched reward distributions to reduce transaction overhead

## Getting Started

(Instructions for setting up and deploying SkillAI agents will be added here upon completion of initial development)
